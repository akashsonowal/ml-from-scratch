# ml-from-scratch

Todo: Merge https://github.com/akashsonowal/ml-coding

Coding for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Research Engineers 

Note: This is purely a learning experiment

## 1. ML & Optimization Algorithms (handson theory)

Python3 + C/C++
=> Standard solution (framework based), Basic Implementation, Optimized Implementation

## 2. ML Utility Functions
=> Spectrogram, Tokenization, Position Encodings, Normalization, Loss Functions, Optimizers etc

## 3. Distributed Algorithms
=> distributed ML algorithms implementations

## 4. Mini Case Studies
=> Live Assist basic app, finetune a VAD etc.
